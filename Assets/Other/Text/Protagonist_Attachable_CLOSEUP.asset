  text: "In September 1944, with the approach of the Red Army, the Germans decided
    to liquidate the Klooga labor camp. \nTheir plan was to murder the prisoners
    and then destroy all evidence of the slaughter. \nEighteen-year-old Benjamin
    and his twenty-two-year-old brother Nisan had only recently arrived at the camp,
    while their uncle, Dr. W\u0142odzimierz Poczter, had been imprisoned there about
    a year earlier."

  text: "It is estimated that 1,800\u20132,000 prisoners perished at Klooga from
    wanton killings, epidemics and working conditions. \n\nMost of them were Jews.\n\nAccording
    to Soviet sources, approximately 2,000 were shot, then their bodies were stacked
    onto wooden pyres and burned. On 22 September 1944, when Soviet troops reached
    the Klooga camp, only 85 of the 2,400 prisoners remaining post-evacuation had
    managed to survive by hiding inside the camp or escaping into the surrounding
    forests."
